# ABOUT
For this task I have learned how to get a varied response from a server based on the input we send to it.(This helps build more accurate dropdown menu found in my Js_Components repo --https://github.com/AustinRado/Js-Frontend_Components)

At this point we want to get different values depending on the menu item that is active, so we want the server to give varied responses based on the data on the data passed.

## DIVE INTO DETAILS OF THE TASK
For this task I'm going to create an input,
Whenever we click a button the client will send the GET request to the server with whatever's been typed into as data.
The cliend will then append the response to a div.
